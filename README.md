# Family Chore Tracker

This app was created to help busy parents keep track of chores their children can do, are doing and allows them to incentivize these chores with a monetary value!  Parents, once an account is created, create accounts for their children and then can begin creating chores for the children.  The children are then able to log in (with the account info chosen by the parent) and select chores to do and mark when these chores are completed.  Once the child has marked the chore complete, it will fall into a queue for the parent to check to be sure it is complete before the balance will be added to the child's account.
My hope is this will keep kids busy during these difficult times while they are at home and allow mom and dad to continue on with their days without multiple phone calls througout the day asking what the kids can do!
